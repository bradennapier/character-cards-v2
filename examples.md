### Tips for Use

- **Consistency Across Characters:** All characters are based in the same world of Aetheria. Their descriptions, tags, and lore entries link them to a shared narrative—ensuring smooth roleplay transitions.
- **Embedded Lore:** Each character includes a `character_book` with lore entries. This helps the AI recall important backstory elements when specific trigger keywords appear during a conversation.
- **System & Post-History Instructions:** Use the provided `system_prompt` and `post_history_instructions` to maintain character voice consistently. The `{{original}}` placeholder ensures that default instructions can be integrated.
- **Alternate Greetings:** Multiple greetings allow the chat interface to offer varied openings, enhancing the roleplay experience.
