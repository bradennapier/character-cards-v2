/**
 * `CharacterCardV2` represents the top-level structure for a Character Card V2 object.
 * This interface is the entry point for defining a character using the Character Card V2 specification.
 * It encapsulates metadata about the specification (such as {@link CharacterCardV2.spec} and {@link CharacterCardV2.spec_version}) and the core character
 * data defined by the {@link CharacterData} interface.
 *
 * @tips
 * - Ensure the {@link CharacterCardV2.spec} field is always set to `"chara_card_v2"` and {@link CharacterCardV2.spec_version} to `"2.0"` to comply with the specification.
 * - The {@link CharacterCardV2.data} property must adhere to the {@link CharacterData} interface, so refer to it for details on each field.
 * - Validate your object against this interface to ensure compatibility with tools and frontends that process Character Card V2.
 *
 * @considerations
 * - When updating a character, update the {@link CharacterData.character_version} to reflect the changes.
 * - Use descriptive language in the {@link CharacterData.description} and {@link CharacterData.personality} fields to maximize the AIâ€™s understanding during roleplay.
 *
 * @see {@link CharacterData} for detailed information on core character properties.
 * @see {@link https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2|Character Card Spec V2 on GitHub} for further details.
