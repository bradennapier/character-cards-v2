# Character Card V2 TypeScript Interfaces

This repository provides a collection of TypeScript interfaces designed for building and validating Character Card V2 objects. These interfaces encapsulate the entire schema needed for AI roleplaying character cardsâ€”from core character details and embedded lore to system-level instructions and custom metadata.

Using these interfaces offers the following benefits:

- **Consistency:** Define character cards with a well-structured, standardized schema.
- **Extensibility:** Easily extend core functionality with custom metadata using the Extensions interface.
- **Rich Documentation:** Inline TSDoc comments provide detailed guidance and examples for each property.
- **Type Safety:** Improve development experience with strict type checking, ensuring that character cards conform to the Character Card V2 specification.
