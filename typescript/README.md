# Character Card V2 TypeScript Interfaces

This repository provides a collection of TypeScript interfaces designed for building and validating Character Card V2 objects. These interfaces encapsulate the entire schema needed for AI roleplaying character cardsâ€”from core character details and embedded lore to system-level instructions and custom metadata.

Using these interfaces offers the following benefits:

- **Consistency:** Define character cards with a well-structured, standardized schema.
- **Extensibility:** Easily extend core functionality with custom metadata using the Extensions interface.
- **Rich Documentation:** Inline TSDoc comments provide detailed guidance and examples for each property.
- **Type Safety:** Improve development experience with strict type checking, ensuring that character cards conform to the Character Card V2 specification.

## Usage

Import the interfaces into your project to create, validate, or manipulate Character Card V2 objects. For example, you might import the complete set of interfaces from the index file:

```typescript
import { CharacterCardV2 } from './index';

// Example: Create a new character card
const myCharacter: CharacterCardV2 = {
  spec: "chara_card_v2",
  spec_version: "2.0",
  data: {
    name: "Queen Seraphina",
    description: "A wise and regal leader of Aetheria.",
    personality: "Authoritative, compassionate, and strategic.",
    scenario: "In the royal palace during a pivotal council meeting.",
    first_mes: "Greetings, loyal subject. I am Queen Seraphina.",
    mes_example: "<START>\n{{user}}: What is your decree?\n{{char}}: Unity and strength shall guide us.",
    creator_notes: "Designed for inspiring leadership and deep roleplay.",
    system_prompt: "{{original}}\nYou are Queen Seraphina, speak formally.",
    post_history_instructions: "Maintain decorum and authority. {{original}}",
    alternate_greetings: [
      "Welcome to the court, I am Queen Seraphina.",
      "Hail, loyal subject. I am your queen."
    ],
    tags: ["royalty", "Aetheria", "leader"],
    creator: "ElyndriaTales",
    character_version: "1.0",
    extensions: { theme_color: "#D4AF37" },
    character_book: {
      name: "Royal Annals",
      description: "Historical lore of the royal lineage.",
      scan_depth: 50,
      token_budget: 300,
      recursive_scanning: false,
      extensions: {},
      entries: []
    }
  }
};
```

## Files Overview

### [character-book.ts](./character-book.ts)

Provides the **`CharacterBook`** interface. This interface is used for embedding a lorebook into a character card. It allows you to package background lore and dynamic lore entries (see [entry.ts](./entry.ts)) that enrich the character's narrative during roleplay.

**Key Benefits:**
- Organizes and encapsulates lore data.
- Enhances context for AI responses by providing dynamic lore based on conversation triggers.

### [character-data.ts](./character-data.ts)

Defines the **`CharacterData`** interface. This file contains all core character properties (e.g., name, description, personality) as well as advanced fields like system prompts, alternate greetings, and an optional lorebook.

**Key Benefits:**
- Centralizes all character-specific information.
- Ensures rich, descriptive context for robust AI roleplay experiences.

### [entry.ts](./entry.ts)

Contains the **`Entry`** interface, which defines individual lore entries for a character's lorebook. Each entry includes trigger keywords, lore content, and optional settings (such as priority and insertion order).

**Key Benefits:**
- Provides granular control over lore injection based on conversation context.
- Facilitates dynamic background detail integration when specific keywords are detected.

### [extensions.ts](./extensions.ts)

Exports the **`Extensions`** interface. This interface serves as a flexible container for custom metadata and additional properties not covered by the standard spec.

**Key Benefits:**
- Offers a safe space for storing extra information without breaking compatibility.
- Supports future-proofing and extensibility for your character cards.

### [system-prompt.ts](./system-prompt.ts)

Defines the **`SystemPromptConfig`** interface, which handles system-level instructions such as custom system prompts and post-history instructions. These settings guide the AI's behavior at critical points in the conversation.

**Key Benefits:**
- Enables fine-tuning of the AI's initial and ongoing behavior.
- Allows creators to override default system prompts with character-specific instructions.

### [index.ts](./index.ts)

The main entry point that consolidates and re-exports all the interfaces. Use this file to import the entire Character Card V2 schema into your project.

**Key Benefits:**
- Simplifies imports by aggregating all interfaces.
- Provides a single source of truth for the entire Character Card V2 specification.
