/**
 * @interface Entry
 * @description Represents an individual lore entry within a {@link CharacterBook}. Each entry provides dynamic 
 * background or contextual information that can be injected into the AI's prompt when specific trigger keywords 
 * (defined in {@link Entry.keys}) are detected in the conversation.
 *
 * @example
 * const entryExample: Entry = {
 *   keys: ["royal", "lineage"],
 *   content: "Queen Seraphina descends from a long line of revered rulers known for their wisdom and valor.",
 *   extensions: {},
 *   enabled: true,
 *   insertion_order: 1,
 *   case_sensitive: false
 * };
 *
 * @tips
 * - Use clear and specific keywords in {@link Entry.keys} to ensure the entry triggers only in the intended context.
 * - Adjust {@link Entry.insertion_order} to control the order of lore injection; lower numbers insert earlier.
 * - Consider setting {@link Entry.priority} if you need to manage which entries are dropped when the token budget is exceeded.
 *
 * @considerations
 * - Avoid overly generic keywords in {@link Entry.keys} to prevent unintended triggers.
 * - Use {@link Entry.selective} with {@link Entry.secondary_keys} when an entry should trigger only under combined conditions.
 * - If an entry should always be present regardless of triggers, set {@link Entry.constant} to true, but ensure it does not
 *   overwhelm the overall token budget.
 *
