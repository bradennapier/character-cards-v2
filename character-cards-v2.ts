/**
 * @interface CharacterBook
 * @description Represents a character-specific lorebook attached to a character card.
 * The lorebook bundles supplementary background details and lore entries that enrich
 * the character's narrative. Each lore entry is defined by the {@link Entry} interface.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example implementation of a CharacterBook:
 * const lorebookExample: CharacterBook = {
 *   name: "Royal Annals",
 *   description: "Contains historical details of the royal lineage and key events that have shaped Aetheria.",
 *   scan_depth: 50,
 *   token_budget: 300,
 *   recursive_scanning: false,
 *   extensions: {},
 *   entries: [
 *     {
 *       keys: ["royal", "lineage"],

 *       enabled: true,
 *       insertion_order: 1,
 *       case_sensitive: false
 *     }
 *   ]
 * };
 *
 * @tips
 * - Use the {@link Entry} interface to structure individual lore entries.
 * - Adjust {@link CharacterBook.scan_depth} to reflect how many recent messages should be scanned for {@link Entry.keys} triggers.
 * - Set {@link CharacterBook.token_budget} carefully to balance the richness of lore details with the prompt's available token space.
 *
 * @considerations
 * - Enable {@link CharacterBook.recursive_scanning} only if you want already inserted lore to trigger additional entries. Use with caution.
 * - Ensure that the {@link CharacterBook.extensions} field is properly namespaced to avoid conflicts with other metadata.
 *
 * @see {@link https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2|Character Card Spec V2 on GitHub} for further details on the specification.
